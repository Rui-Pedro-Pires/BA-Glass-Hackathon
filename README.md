# BA Glass - Creative Lab

During one week, 18 students were divided into three groups to develop three different projects related to issues raised by BA-Glass. For the solutions, the use of tools from Google Cloud was encouraged. </br></br>
Our group's task was to use software available on Google Cloud Services to manipulate a set of data supplied by BA Glass to answer specific questions regarding that data.
Specifically, the objective of our work was to determine the best set of values to maximize production throughput from a dataset of adjustments to production parameters.

## Data and Implementation
The dataset provided consisted of timing changes for specific movements within the production process. To be able to draw conclusions from the data supplied, a set of operations were implemented to present the data:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed inconsistencies and unnecessary details from the dataset.
2. **Data Transformation**: Modified the data to be better suited for analysis and visualization.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Built a dashboard to display and analyze the cleaned data, allowing BA Glass to visualize trends and timing adjustments easily.

## Results
- We identified a preliminary set of values that could help optimize the production throughput.
- The analysis was an important first step, and further exploration is required to account for other factors influencing productivity.
